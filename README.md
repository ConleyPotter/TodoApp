# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## "Todo App"

This is the Todo application that I created for
[*The Web Developer Bootdcamp*](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content)
by [Colt Steele](https://github.com/Colt). 

This is a simple to do app where one can add todos, delete them, and mark them as done.

This app does not yet have a back-end, so sessions will not be saved.

[*The App can be found here*](https://calm-anchorage-97395.herokuapp.com/), hosted by heroku.

The HTML, Stylesheets and Scripts were created while wathcing a code along with Cole Steele. However, I added these files to a new rails app, and I included the correct gems and JS libraries on my own.
